These files contain _only_ the sentences that contain some negation
from the training set. Cues are marked as prefixes on the POS tags
(e.g. Q1-, Q2- etc.). The associated scopes are marked on the surface
forms as prefixes (e.g. all forms prefixed with Q1- are in scope of
the cue Q1). The associated events are marked as suffixes on the
surface forms (e.g. all forms suffixed with -E1 are events of the cue
Q1).

In order to make the parse trees readable by vpf, the surface forms
and POS tags have been massaged slightly. Specifically, the tags
'PRP$' and 'WP$' are replaced with 'PRPd' and 'WPh',
respectively. Moreover, all ' (single-quotes) in tags and forms are
replaced by backticks (`). Additionally, the surface forms (, ), [,
and ] are replaced with -LRB-, -RRB-, -LSB-, and -RSB-, respectively.
